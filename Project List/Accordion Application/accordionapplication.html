          Kotlin is a modern programming language that is concise, expressive,
          and designed to be fully interoperable with Java. It is statically
          typed and supports both object-oriented and functional programming
          paradigms. Kotlin is officially supported by Google for Android
          development and has gained popularity for its safety features,
